# stonerunner
This is a basic top-down runner game in which you have to pass through enemies and activate an altar, which will activate the next level.
No of levels-5
the levels gradually increase in difficulty.

In game lore/help text - "Stony boi is on the lookout for the immense mana he gets from mana altars, but alas, his path is blocked by Treants, who have large bodies, larger trigger radius, but slow movement speed and moles, who have fast movement, but low trigger range and smaller bodies.

Each level has the same map but some obstacles may be differently placed, and the number of enemies may be different."

I tried to make the movement as smooth as possible, and the colliders as accurate as possible.

Thanks.

P.S. if the game doesnt function as it's supposed to or doesn't load the next level even if you reached the altar, please restart the game and it should run fine.
